// Assume you have already deployed the SimulatedStaking contract
SimulatedStaking stakingContract = SimulatedStaking(contractAddress); // Replace contractAddress with the deployed contract address

// Step 1: Stake 0.5 ETH
stakingContract.stake{value: 0.5 ether}();

// Step 2: Wait for a Day (simulate)

// Step 3: Check Rewards
uint balanceAfterOneDay = stakingContract.getBalance();

// Step 4: Withdraw and Reinvest
stakingContract.withdraw(balanceAfterOneDay); // Withdraw all balance including rewards
stakingContract.stake{value: balanceAfterOneDay}(); // Reinvest the withdrawn amount
